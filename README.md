# GitHub search feature - js-exercise

Uses the [Github Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search) to query users.

## Run locally

1. Clone [the repository](https://github.com/dillionmegida/js-exercise)
2. Change current directory to the project's directory - `cd js-exercise`
3. Install dependencies - `npm install`
4. Run development server `npm run dev` (not `npm run start`)

## Serve project with Node.js

`npm run start` is used to start the Node.js server (configured in server.js) which would serve the files in the `build` directory. The `build` directory is generated upon running `npm run build` so it has to exist, else the server would throw an error.
